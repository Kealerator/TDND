# TDND - Text-Based Dungeons and Dragons

TDND is a hobby project that combines the concepts of Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) with text-based gaming. This project serves as an exploration of Java coding, with potential future plans for Kotlin and Android development.

## Project Overview

The project is in its early stages, featuring two main class files. One handles dice rolling, while the other sets attribute scores with modifiers. The ultimate goal is to develop character-building functionality with at least three different classes and races, a basic combat tutorial, and a custom combat simulator.

## Key Features

- Dice rolling functionality
- Attribute score calculation with modifiers
- Future plans for character building, classes, races, combat tutorial, and a custom combat simulator

## Getting Started

As of now, the project is a work in progress, and installation details are not available.

## Usage

To use the current version of TDND, simply interact with the provided class files. Detailed instructions and features are expected to be added as the project develops.

## Known Issues

The project is in the early stages, and input validation is not implemented. Users are advised to input valid values to avoid unexpected behavior.

## How to Contribute

Currently, there are no specific guidelines for contributions. This may change as the project progresses.

## Contact

For any issues, suggestions, or general communication, feel free to create an issue on GitHub. Responses may take some time, as this is a side project.
